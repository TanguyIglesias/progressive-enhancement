   <h2>The story</h2>
   <p class="first-p">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, </p><q class="bad">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is the most unfortunate.</q><p> The farmer said, </p><q><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q><p> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, </p><q class="good">Oh, isn't that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q><p> The farmer again said,</p> <q><strong>Maybe</strong></q><p>.The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, </p><q class="bad">Oh dear, that's too bad,</q><p> and the farmer responded, </p><q><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q><p> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,</p> <q class="good">Isn't that great!</q><p> Again, he said</p> <q><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q>
   <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>
